The persistent WebSocket failures in your AgentScaleSuite project appear to stem from multiple factors, including API access limitations, incorrect API usage, and frontend integration issues. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

‚ö†Ô∏è 1. API Access Limitations
Your logs indicate a 404 error when attempting to use the computer-use-preview model:
community.openai.com

"The model computer-use-preview-2025-03-11 does not exist or you do not have access to it."

This suggests that your OpenAI API key lacks access to the computer-use-preview model. Access to this model is limited and requires explicit approval from OpenAI. Even users with Tier 3 access have reported similar issues .

Recommended Action:

Apply for access to the computer-use-preview model through OpenAI's official channels.

üß± 2. Incorrect API Usage
There are discrepancies in your API request payloads, particularly concerning the input field. The computer-use-preview model expects the input to be structured with a specific type. Using "type": "text" instead of the correct "type": "input_text" can lead to errors.

Correct Format Example:

json
Copy
Edit
"input": [
  {
    "type": "input_text",
    "text": "Go to bing.com and search for OpenAI news."
  }
]
Recommended Action:

Review and update your API request payloads to ensure they conform to the expected structure.

üñºÔ∏è 3. Frontend Integration Issues
The frontend component responsible for displaying live browser automation appears to have integration issues:

WebSocket Endpoint Conflicts: The WebSocket server is initialized, but clients aren't connecting. This could be due to conflicts with Vite's development server or incorrect WebSocket paths.

Client-Side Handling: The LiveScreenshotStream component expects raw base64 data, but the server sends JSON messages. This mismatch can prevent proper rendering of live screenshots.

Recommended Actions:

Adjust WebSocket Paths: Modify the WebSocket server path to avoid conflicts, such as using /ws/screenshots instead of the default path.

Update Client-Side Parsing: Ensure the client correctly parses the JSON messages received from the server to extract and display the base64-encoded screenshots.

Verify Component Integration: Confirm that the LiveScreenshotStream component is correctly imported and rendered within the AgentChat component.

üß™ 4. Testing with Fallback Models
Given the access issues with the computer-use-preview model, it's prudent to implement a fallback mechanism using the gpt-4o model, which supports vision capabilities. This ensures continued functionality while awaiting access to the desired model.

Recommended Action:

Implement Fallback Logic: Modify your application to attempt using the computer-use-preview model first and fall back to gpt-4o if access is denied.

‚úÖ Summary of Recommendations
Apply for Access: Request access to the computer-use-preview model through OpenAI.
learn.microsoft.com

Correct API Payloads: Ensure your API requests use the correct input structure with "type": "input_text".

Resolve Frontend Issues:

Adjust WebSocket server paths to prevent conflicts.

Update client-side code to correctly parse and display incoming screenshot data.

Verify the integration of the LiveScreenshotStream component.

Implement Fallback Mechanism: Use gpt-4o as a fallback model to maintain functionality during access issues.
